Problem Statement:- Programming ADC and show analog to digital conversion and displaying digital value on suitable interface().

ADC programming refers to the process of configuring and utilizing an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) in a microcontroller or embedded system. The programming involves setting up the ADC hardware and implementing the necessary software routines to control and utilize the ADC.

The STM32F407VG microcontroller has three successive approximation type ADC modules such as ADC1, ADC2, and ADC3. These ADC modules share 16 analog input channels. This means there are a total of 16 analog input channels available for the STM32F4 discovery board.


In the problem statement, it has been asked to show ADC for the STM32F4 Discovery Board and it includes:-

GPIO Configuration - GPIO pins ensure proper communication, control, and synchronization between the microcontroller/SBC and the ADC, allowing for accurate and reliable analog-to-digital conversion.

ADC Channel Configuration - We can select multiple channels for ADC conversion. Configure the specific ADC channels we want to use for conversion. Each channel corresponds to a specific pin on the microcontroller.

Start ADC Conversion - Start the ADC conversion by triggering it manually or using a timer or other triggering mechanisms, here we have used a Systick Clock which needs to be configured separately. 

Reading and Processing ADC Values - After the conversion is complete, we can read the converted values from the ADC data register. The STM32F4 ADC can store the converted values in either a single data register or a regular sequence of data registers.



For programming ADC and showing interfacing of analog sensors for given specifications follows all the instructions followed in the first problem including some extra steps:-

Connect the Analog Sensor: Connect the output of the analog sensor to one of the available ADC input pins on the STM32F407VGTx board.   

Configure ADC Pins: Set the GPIO pins corresponding to the ADC input pins as analog inputs.

Initialize ADC: Initialize the ADC module by setting its parameters, such as clock prescaler, resolution, and conversion mode.

ADC Conversion and Reading Values

The output can be observed from the watch dialog box where the variable(myAdcValue) whose value has been stored in one of the registers.
